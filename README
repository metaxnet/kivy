My App featuring a knight and some baddies!
Divide and Conquer is a family effort: 
Code by metaxpap
Graphics and management by metaxmom
Sound and Character Design by metaxboy

Drag the numbers to the knight. The X button
closes the App AND resets it to level 1. Otherwise
play will continue from current level.

Divide and Conquer was written on Ubuntu13.10 and
tested on Samsung Galaxy S3 and an anonymous Chinese
tablet.

Have fun and thanks for Kivy. It's wonderful!
